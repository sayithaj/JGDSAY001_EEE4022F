## Abstract
Wireless power transfer (WPT) has become a promising method for delivering electrical energy
without the need for physical connections, with applications ranging from electric vehicle charging
to consumer electronics and medical implants. In recent years, renewable energy has also driven
a widespread adoption of solar power due to its environmental benefits, scalability, and low
maintenance costs. This study explores the integration of solar panels with WPT systems, focusing
on performance impacts and feasibility under real-time solar-powered operation. Experimental
tests were conducted to assess how WPT coil placement, operating frequency, and power levels
influence the electrical and thermal behavior of the panel. Current-voltage (IV) and power-voltage
(PV) curves were recorded across different configurations, and thermal imaging was used to monitor
hotspot formation. Additionally, the system was tested under solar-powered WPT conditions,
where the panel directly supplied power to the WPT coils. ANSYS Maxwell and Icepak simulations
were performed to analyze magnetic field distribution, coil heating, and efficiency.
Results showed that active WPT coil operation led to reductions in output power and solar panel
efficiency, especially at higher frequencies and power levels, due to electromagnetic interference
and heat buildup. Thermal imaging and simulations confirmed that the use of WPT coils in
this system, especially without ferrite backing, produces temperature rises and hotspot formation
on the solar panel, with higher magnetic field penetration and eddy current losses. The systen
integration tests confirmed that it is feasible to directly power a WPT system using solar energy,
but efficiency is highly dependent on frequency tuning and load matching. These findings highlight
the potential of solarâ€“WPT integration, while also emphasising the need for careful system design
to mitigate PV performance degradation and maximise power transfer.
